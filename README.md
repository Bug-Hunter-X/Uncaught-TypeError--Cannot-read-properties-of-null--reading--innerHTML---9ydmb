# Uncommon HTML Bug: Accessing Removed DOM Element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where attempting to access the properties of a DOM element after it's been removed from the Document Object Model (DOM) results in a `TypeError`.  The error message is typically `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'innerHTML')` or similar, depending on the property you're trying to access.

The bug occurs because `element.remove()` completely detaches the element from the DOM tree.  Any subsequent attempts to access its properties will fail because the element no longer exists in the DOM.

The solution involves ensuring that you only access the element's properties *before* removing it or checking for its existence in the DOM before accessing any properties.
